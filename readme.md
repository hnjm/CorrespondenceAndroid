Correspondence for Android
==========================

Correspondence is a collaboration framework. That means that it helps
people and devices to communicate with one another. A Correspondence
application running on one device synchronizes its local data store with
Correspodence applications running on other devices. These could all belong
to the same person, or to different people.

With Correspondence, you get:
* Local device storage
* Synchronization
* Push notification
* User interface updates

This project is the Android client. Other clients include:
* WPF
* Silverlight
* Windows Phone
* ASP.NET MVC (yes, a web site is a Correspondence client)

You can compile your Correspondence model to any of these clients. The
apps that you develop against the common model will collaborate, even across
platforms. Write an Android, Windows Phone, and Web version of your app
and Correspondence will keep them all in sync.
